# Database Management Systems Lab

This repository contains the practical implementations for the Database Management Systems (DBMS) Lab. The goal of these exercises is to develop hands-on skills in SQL, PL/SQL, ER modeling, triggers, and connectivity using ODBC.

## üìå Practical Aims

1. **ER & EER Modeling**  
   Draw an ER diagram and EER diagram, convert them into a relational database, and draw the corresponding schema diagram.

2. **Basic SQL Queries**  
   Write and execute SQL queries using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.  
   *(Instructor to provide the problem definition.)*

3. **SQL Functions**  
   Use and test aggregate, numeric, date, string, and conversion functions in SQL.

4. **SQL Operators**  
   Write SQL queries using logical and comparison operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`.

5. **Subqueries and Joins**  
   Implement and execute subqueries and various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).

6. **Basic PL/SQL Programs**  
   Write and execute basic PL/SQL programs with condition statements, loops, and simple logic.

7. **PL/SQL Functions**  
   Create a PL/SQL function to print or return the binary equivalent of a given decimal number.

8. **PL/SQL Procedures**  
   Write a PL/SQL procedure to simulate transferring funds between two accounts.

9. **Triggers in PL/SQL**  
   Write and execute database triggers using PL/SQL.

10. **ODBC Connectivity**  
   Create and perform database operations using **ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)**.
